Replace data sources specified in .env with DataSources managed by DataManager

If input files in .env have been changed from the default values (.env.example),
these overrides will no longer be read. The URL in the corresponding DataSource
must be updated to reflect the override, or a new DataSource must be created
to reflect the custom resource.
